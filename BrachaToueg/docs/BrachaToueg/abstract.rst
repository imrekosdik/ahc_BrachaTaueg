In distributed systems, deadlocks occur due to resource sharing - the concept determines how existing resources are shared and accessed across the system. A deadlock is a condition that the processes request access to resources held by other processes in the system. Resolving the deadlocks is crucial because the processes involved are blocked and waiting indefinitely to acquire resources from the others. Deadlock handling is a challenging problem in distributed systems because no site knows the system state, and the communication involves finite and unpredictable delays. Deadlock detection is one of the approaches to handling deadlocks. It consists of examining the system for a cyclic wait. The :ref:`Bracha-Toueg Deadlock Detection Algorithm <BrachaTouegDeadlockDetectionAlgorithm>` is a simple and efficient deadlock detection algorithm and is under global state detection-based algorithms. The main idea behind the algorithm is that deadlocks are detectable by taking a snapshot of the system. In this paper, we contribute to the research of deadlock detection by implementing the :ref:`Bracha-Toueg Deadlock Detection Algorithm <BrachaTouegDeadlockDetectionAlgorithm>` on the AHCv2 Platform, along with anaylzing the message and time complexity by running the algorithm on different network topologies and various number of nodes.
