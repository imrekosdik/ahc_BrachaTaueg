Conclusion
==========

The Bracha-Toueg Deadlock Detection Algorithm is a reliable and adaptable solution for identifying and resolving deadlocks in distributed systems across various network topologies. We have explored the algorithm extensively, emphasizing its significance, implementation intricacies, and message complexity evaluation. Our analysis of the algorithm's message complexity has demonstrated its efficiency and practicality. By using the ad-hoc computing library, we have conducted experiments that show a message complexity of O(4E), which is in line with theoretical expectations. This high efficiency makes the algorithm suitable for real-world distributed systems. If the algorithm is included in the ad-hoc computing library, anyone can use it in their research. We discussed how we implemented the request mechanism in Section 1.4.3. In future work, we could approach the issue differently and change the implementation to reflect requests as not specific events but messages that belong to the algorithm having a deadlock in the system. We also mentioned that the Lai-Yang Snapshot implementation only considers the specific request messages and discards others as they do not relate to deadlock detection. Another approach would be considering all kinds of messages, but not storing the messages' contents would be more efficient and generic because what is in a message is irrelevant.
