Conclusion
==========

The Bracha-Toueg Deadlock Detection Algorithm is a reliable and adaptable solution for identifying and resolving deadlocks in distributed systems across various network topologies. We have explored the algorithm extensively, emphasizing its significance, implementation intricacies, and message complexity evaluation. Our analysis of the algorithm's message complexity has demonstrated its efficiency and practicality. By using the ad-hoc computing library, we have conducted experiments that show a message complexity of O(4E), which is in line with theoretical expectations. This high efficiency makes the algorithm suitable for real-world distributed systems.
